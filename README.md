**CoronaStories** is a message board storytelling app in which users from around the world can share stories of any size about thei experiences with the COVID-19 Pandemic of 2020. 

For most people, the lived experience of the pandemic is so varied and personal, however, it is also one of the first truly global experirences of its kind in over a century.

## The App

The app itself is a full CRUD app featuring a Rails API backend with a React client setup. Users can create a story entry, add it to the main page, edit the story, and delete the story, if they wish.

## Technical Aspects

As a team project, this app allowed us to split the production duties roughly 50/50. During errors, we used the Zoom video platform to troubleshoot and pair code to great effect. One particularly troubling aspect of both of our previous team projects - Git repo work - was significantly easier this time around, making for a smooth collaborative process.


Thank you! **Stay safe and healthy out there!!!**
